        <h1>CS 165 Team Activities</h1>

        <p>A critical part of this online course is that you will work in small teams to complete an assignment each week.</p>

        <h3>Team Formation Process</h3>

        <p>During the first week of the course, you will fill out an availability survey to list the general times that are available each week. Then, using this information, the instructor will assign you to a team of three students.</p>

        <h3>Weekly Meeting</h3>

        <p>Then, each week you are required to meet with your team for 1 hour to complete a team assignment. This meeting must be synchronous (i.e., not just coordinating via email). You may use whatever technology you like for this meeting (e.g., Skype, Google Hangouts, etc.), but you must be able to 1) hear and talk to each team member, and 2) share your screen with each other. This meeting must be complete each week by Wednesday Night.</p>

        <p>During this meeting you will all contribute to developing a single program. At the conclusion of the meeting, the person who physically has the code for the assignment should email a copy to the other team members.</p>

        <h3>Deliverables and Grading</h3>
        <p>Each team activity will consist of 3 core requirements and 3 stretch challenges. After completing your meeting, each team member must individually submit a quiz indicating the portion completed. Please note that the vast majority of the points for the team activity are earned by being present, on-time, and actively participating. If you do that, you will receive between 90-110% depending on how many of the core / stretch requirements you complete.</p>

        <h3>Work beyond the one hour meeting</h3>
        <p>You are more than welcome to continue working on the requirements after the 1 hour period (either by yourself or with your team), and can report any requirements completed by this work. But keep in mind that the expectation here is that you work together for 1 hour and do your best during that time, and if you do not quite finish at the end of that hour, you can set it aside, report on what you did complete, and move on to your individual assignments.</p>
